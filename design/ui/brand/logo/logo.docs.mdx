import { RecommendedSizes } from './recommended-sizes';
import { Logo } from './logo';

Renders the Bit logo by importing a local svg file. This component is the most recommended way to use the Bit Logo across React apps.

### Logo with recommended size

Use the `size` prop to control the recommended size of the logo.

```js live
<Logo size={RecommendedSizes.large} />
```

## Logo with custom size

If you need to have a different size, you can use the `customSize` prop and add in the size you require.

```js live
<Logo customSize={64} />
```
